# PotionCraft No Bullshit Prices
Allows you to modify the merchants prices by a configurable modifier, allowing you to make things much easier, or harder for yourself. No more bullshit prices!
## Config
`priceModifier` The modifier that is applied to the merchants item prices. The base price is multiplied by the modifier. For example: If the base price is 20 and the modifier is 0.5 the price of the item would become 20 * 0.5. To add a challenge to your game increase the modifier above 1 ;).
